1. What are the working hours?
Our standard working hours are 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Monday through Friday, with a one-hour lunch break. However, certain teams or roles may have flexible schedules depending on project requirements. If you need adjustments, please discuss them in advance with your manager and HR so we can review and approve any necessary arrangements.

2. Can you explain the leave policy?
Certainly. Our leave policy includes:
Annual Paid Leave: You accrue [X] days per year (this varies by tenure and role).
Sick Leave: [X] days per year, which you can use when you’re unwell—please notify your manager as early as possible.
Casual/Personal Leave: For urgent personal matters, subject to prior approval.
Public Holidays: As per the company calendar.
Unpaid Leave: Can be requested if you’ve exhausted your paid leave balance and require additional time off; approval is at management’s discretion.
All leave requests should be submitted through the HR portal or leave management system, ideally with reasonable notice so coverage can be arranged.

3. How do I report a technical issue?
If you experience any technical issues (hardware, software, or system access), please follow this process:
Log a ticket with the IT Helpdesk—either via the internal support portal or by emailing [IT support email].
Include clear details—describe the issue, any error messages, and when it started.
If it’s urgent, call the IT support line directly.
HR is also here to assist if you’re unsure whom to contact, but the first point of resolution is always the IT Helpdesk.

4. What’s the company’s dress code?
Our dress code is business casual, unless your role requires otherwise.
For client meetings or formal presentations: business professional attire is expected.
On Fridays or designated casual days: smart casual is acceptable.
Clothing should always be neat, clean, and appropriate for a professional environment.

5. How can I improve communication within the team?
That’s a great question and an important focus area. Here are some practical recommendations:
Hold regular team meetings to align on priorities and expectations.
Use collaboration tools (like Slack, Teams, or project management software) consistently so everyone stays informed.
Be proactive in sharing updates and clarifying doubts rather than waiting for issues to escalate.
Encourage open dialogue—create an environment where team members feel comfortable raising concerns or offering suggestions.
Seek feedback regularly—both formally and informally—so you can adapt your approach as needed.
